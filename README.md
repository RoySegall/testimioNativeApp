# Testim IO Native app

## Setup

Go the official [documentation set up guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) and pick the 
`React native CLI quick start`

### Ruby
After installing `rbenv` for managing the ruby version add to the `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`, or where you manage your 
aliases, add the next line:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/shims:$PATH"
```

The version needs to be 2.7.5. It's old but this the version

### Not working?
If the rbenv not installing the version correctly - reboot your computer
if the app is failed to compile and run on the simulator - reboot your computer

Seems odd but this was written in tears ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
